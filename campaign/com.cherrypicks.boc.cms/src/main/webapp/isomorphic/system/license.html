</p>

<p><b>SINGLE DEVELOPER / SINGLE ORGANIZATION LICENSE:</b> The Software is licensed herein for
development use by a single individual, to create software products on behalf of a single
organization.  This is a "named user" license - all developers who use the Product SDK in
the development of Integrated Products must be individually licensed.
</p>


<p><b>1. DEFINITIONS</b><br><br>

(a) "Deploy" or "Deployment" means installation of software programs onto computer server
     systems that may be accessed by individual end users over a computer network.<br><br>

(b) "Documentation" means the generally available user manuals and reference guides that
     describe the capabilities and use of the Software.<br><br>

(c) "Licensed Developer(s)" means all individuals, specified by 'First Name' and 'Last Name' in the
     registration process prior to downloading the Software, who have accepted this Agreement.  A
     Licensed Developer may be an independent consultant or contractor to the Licensed
     Organization.<br><br>

(d) "Licensed Organization" means the company, organization, or other legal entity that you 
     specify as 'Company/Organization' in the registration process prior to downloading the 
     Software. If you do not specify a valid legal entity as the 'Company/Organization', 
     you are the Licensed Organization.<br><br>

(e) "Software" means the current version of the Smart GWT&trade; and SmartClient&trade; Pro;
     software and documentation supplied by Isomorphic under this Agreement, and any updates to
     this software and documentation that you are entitled to receive under this Agreement.  The
     Software includes all components which are made separately available under the SmartClient
     and Smart GWT LGPL licenses, except governed by this license instead.  The Software also
     includes the SmartClient/Smart GWT server framework, but does not include any components that are
     explicitly limited to SmartClient/Smart GWT Power or Enterprise Editions, or optional components that may be
     included in evaluation versions of the SmartClient/Smart GWT product and labeled as
     'Optional' in the Documentation.<br><br>

     Developer(s) which incorporate the Product Runtime.<br><br>

     <br><br>

(h) "Product SDK" or "SDK" means the complete set of tools and documentation intended
	 for use in developing SmartClient & Smart GWT applications.  For SmartClient, this means the
